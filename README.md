* Provides a `setRadius` method to change the circle's radius.
* Provides a `getArea` method to calculate and return the circle's area.

## Technologies Used

* Java

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2.  Compile the `Circle.java` file using `javac Circle.java`.
3.  Run a class with a main method that uses the circle class.
4.  The program will output the circle's radius and area to the console.
